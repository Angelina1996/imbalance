Title: Algorithms to Preprocess Imbalanced Datasets
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: ncordon
Description: Algorithms to treat imbalanced datasets. Imbalanced datasets usually damage
             the performance of the classifiers. Thus, it is important to treat data before
             applying a classifier algorith. This package includes recent preprocessing algorithms
             in the literature.
