# Imbalance classification problem
Let:

  * $S=\{(x_1, y_1), \ldots (x_m, y_m)\}$ be our training data for a classification problem.
  * $S^{+} = \{(x,y) \in S: y=1\}$ be the positive or minority instances.
  * $S^{-} = \{(x,y) \in S: y=-1\}$ be the negative or majority instances.

If $|S^{+}| > |S^{-}|$, classification algorithms' performances are highly hindered, specially when it comes to the positive class. Therefore, methods to improve that performance are required. 

Namely, `imbalance` package provides *oversampling* algorithms. Those family of procedures aim to generate a set $E$ of synthetic positive instances based on the training ones, so that we have a new classification problem with $\bar{S}^{+} = S^{+} \cup E$, $\bar{S}^{-} = S^{-}$ and $\bar{S} = \bar{S}^{+}\cup \bar{S}^{-}$ our new training set.

# Contents of the package

In the package, we have the following *oversampling* functions available:

* `mwmote`
* `racog`
* `wracog`
* `rwo`
* `pdfos`

Each of these functions can be applied to the data included in the package, which are imbalanced datasets. For example, we can run `pdfos` algorithm on `newthyroid1` imbalanced dataset to get 80 examples:

```{r example-pdfos, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
library("imbalance")
data(newthyroid1)

newSamples <- pdfos(dataset = newthyroid1, numInstances = 80,
                    classAttr = "Class")
```

All of the algorithms can be used with the minimal parameters `dataset`, `numInstances` and `classAttr`, except for `wRACOG`, which does not have a `numInstances` parameter. The latter adjusts this number itself, and needs two datasets (more accurately, two partitions of the same dataset), `train` and `validation` to work.

The package also includes a method to plot a visual comparison between the oversampled dataset and the old
imbalanced dataset:

```{r example-plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
# Bind a balanced dataset
newDataset <- rbind(newthyroid1, newSamples)
# Plot a visual comparison between new and old dataset
plotComparison(newthyroid1, newDataset, 
               attrs = names(newthyroid1)[1:3], 
               cols = 2, classAttr = "Class")
```

There is also a filtering example available, `neater`, which could be used with every oversampling method, either included in this package or in another one:

```{r example-neater, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
filteredSamples <- neater(newthyroid1, newSamples, 
                          iterations = 500)
filteredNewDataset <- rbind(newthyroid1, filteredSamples)
plotComparison(newthyroid1, filteredNewDataset, 
               attrs = names(newthyroid1)[1:3])
```

# Oversampling
## MWMOTE
SMOTE is a classic algorithm which generates new examples by filling empty areas among the positive instances, it updates the training set iteratively, by perfoming:

\[E:=E\cup\{r+(y-x)\}, \quad x,y\in S^{+}, r\sim N(0,1)\]

It has a major setback though: it does not detect noisy instances. Therefore it can generate synthetic examples out of noisy ones or even between two minority classes, which if not cleansed up, may end up becoming noise inside a majority class cluster.

```{r, out.width="60%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='SMOTE generating noise', echo=FALSE, fig.pos="h"}
knitr::include_graphics("smote-flaws.png")
```

MWMOTE (*Majority Weighted Minority Oversampling Technique*) tries to overcome both problems. It intends to give more weight to borderline instances, small size minority cluster instances and examples near the borderline of the two clases. 

Let us recall the header of the method:

```
mwmote(dataset, numInstances, kNoisy, kMajority, kMinority,
       threshold, cmax, cclustering, classAttr)
```

A KNN algorithm will be used, where we call $d(x,y)$ the euclidean distance between $x$ and $y$. Let $NN^{k}(x)\subseteq S$ be the $k$-neighbourhood of $x$ among the whole trainning set (the $k$ closest instances with euclidean distance). Let $NN_{+}^k(x) \subseteq S^{+}$ be its $k$ minority neighbourhood and $NN_{-}^k(x) \subseteq S^{-}$ be its $k$ majority neighbourhood.

For ease of notation, we will name $k_1:=$`KNoisy`, $k_2:=$`KMajority`, $k_3:=$`KMinority`, $\alpha:=$`threshold`, $C:=$`clust`, $C_{clust}:=$`cclustering`.

We define $I_{\alpha,C}(x,y) = C_f(x,y) \cdot D_f(x,y)$, where if $x \notin NN_{+}^{k_3}(y)$ then $I_{\alpha,C}w(x,y) = 0$. 
Otherwise:
\[
  f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
                x &, x\le \alpha \\
                C & \textrm{en otro caso}
               \end{array}\right.,\qquad C_f(x,y) = \frac{C}{\alpha} \cdot f\left(\frac{d}{d(x,y)}\right)
\]

$C_f$ measures the closeness to $y$, that is, it will measure the closeness of borderline instances.

$D_f(x,y) = \frac{C_f(x,y)}{\sum_{z\in V} C_f(z,y)}$ will represent a density factor so an instance belonging 
to a compact cluster will have higher $\sum C_f(z,y)$ than another one belonging to a more sparse one.

Let $T_{clust}:= C_{clust} \cdot \frac{1}{|S_f^{+}|} \sum_{x\in S_f^{+}} \underset{y\in S_f^{+}, y\neq x}{min} d(x,y)$. We will also use a mean-average agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the minority instances with threshold $T_{clust}$, that is, we will use a mean distance:
\[dist(L_i, L_j) = \frac{1}{|L_i||L_j|} \sum_{x\in L_i} \sum_{y\in L_j} d(x,y)\]
and having started with a cluster per instance, and will proceed to join nearest clusters until minimum of distances is lower than $T_{clust}$.  

A general outline of the algorithm is:

* Firstly, MWMOTE computes a set of filtered positive instances: $S_f^{+}$, by erasing those instances whose $k_1$-neighborhood does not contain any positive instance.
* Secondly, it computes the positive boundary of $S_f^{+}$, that is, $U = \cup_{x \in S^{+}_f} NN_{-}^{k_2}(x)$ and the negative boundary by doing $V = \cup_{x \in U} NN_{+}^{k_3}(x)$.
* For each $x\in V$ compute probability of picking $x$ by assigning: $P(x) = \sum_{y\in U} I_{\alpha, C}(x,y)$ and normalizing those probabilities.
* Then, it calculates $L_1, \ldots, L_M$ clusters of $S^{+}$, with the aforementioned jerarquical agglomerative clustering algorithm and threshold $T_{clust}$.
* Generate `numInstances` examples by iteratively picking $x\in V$ with respect to probability $P(x)$, and updating $E:=E\cup \{x+r(y-x)\}$, where $y\in L_k$ uniformly picked and $L_k$ is the cluster containing $x$.


A few interesting considerations:

* Low $k_2$ is required in order to ensure we do not pick too many negative instances.
* For an opposite reason, a high $k_3$ must be selected to ensure we pick as many positive hard-to-learn borderline examples as we can.
* The higher the $C_{clust}$ parameter, the less and more-populated clusters we will get.

## RACOG and wRACOG
These set of algorithms assume that what we want to approximate is a discrete distribution $P(W_1, \ldots, W_d)$.

Computing that distribution can be too expensive, because we have to compute:
\[
  |\{\textrm{Feasible values for }W_1\}| \cdots |\{\textrm{Feasible values for} W_d\}|
\]
total values.

We are going to approximate $P(W_1, \ldots, W_d)$ as $\prod_{i=1}^d P(W_i \mid W_{n(i)})$ where $n(i) \in \{1, \ldots, d\}$. Chow-Liu's algorithm \ref{alg:chowliu} will be used to meet that purpose. This algorithm minimizes Kullback-Leibler distance between two distributions:
\[
  D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) = \sum_{i} P(i) \left(\log P(i) - \log Q(i)\right)
\]

We recall the definition for the mutual information of two random discrete variables $W_i, W_j$:
\[
  I(W_i, W_j) = \sum_{w_1\in W_1} \sum_{w_2\in W_2} p(w_1, w_2) \log\left(\frac{p(w_1,w_2)}{p(w_1) p(w_2)}\right)
\]

Let $S^{+}=\{x_i = (w_1^(i), \ldots, w_d^(i))\}_{i=1}^m$ be the unlabled positive instances. The algorithm to approximate the distribution that will be used is:

* Compute $G'=(E',V')$, Chow Liu's dependence tree.
* If $r$ is the root of the tree, we will define $P(W_r|n(r)):=P(W_r)$.
* For each $(u,v) \in E$ arc in the tree, $n(v):=u$ and compute $P(W_v | W_{n(v)})$.


```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='Markov chain', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("monte-carlo.png")
```

A Gibbs Sampling scheme would later be used to extract samples with respect to the approximated probability distribution, where a badge of new instances is obtained by performing:

* Given a minority sample $x_m = (w_1^{(i)}, \ldots w_d^{(i)})$.
* Iteratively construct for each attribute \[\bar{w}_k^{(i)} \sim P(W_k \mid \bar{w}_1^{(i)}, \ldots, \bar{w}_{k-1}^{(i)}, w_{k+1}^{(i)} \ldots, w_{d}^{(i)})\].
* Return $S = \{\bar{x}_i=(\bar{w}_1^{(i)}, \ldots \bar{w}_d^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^m$.

Let us recall the headers of `racog` and `wracog` functions:

```
racog(dataset, numInstances, burnin, lag, classAttr)
```
```
wracog(train, validation, wrapper, slideWin, 
       threshold, classAttr, ...)
```


### RACOG
RACOG (*Rapidly Converging Gibbs*) iteratively builds badges of synthetic instances using minority given ones. But it rules out first `burnin` generated badges and from that moment onwards, it picks a badge of newly-generated examples each `lag` iterations.

### wRACOG
The downside of RACOG is that it clearly depends on `burnin`, `lag` and the requested number of instances `numInstances`. wRACOG (*wrapper-based RACOG*) tries to overcome that problem. Let `wrapper` be a classifier, that could be declared as it follows:

```{r, results=FALSE}
myWrapper <- structure(list(), class="C50Wrapper")
trainWrapper.C50Wrapper <- function(wrapper, train, trainClass){
  C50::C5.0(train, trainClass)
}
```


That is, a `wrapper` should be an `S3` class with a method `trainWrapper` following the generic method:
```
trainWrapper(wrapper, train, trainClass, ...)
```

where `train` is the unlabeled tranining dataset, and `trainClass` are the labels for the training set.

## RWO
RWO (*Random Walk Oversampling*) generates synthetic instances so that mean and deviation of numerical attributes remain as close as possible to the original ones. This algorithm is inspired by the central limit theorem.

### Central limit theorem
Let $W_1, \ldots, W_m$ be a collection of independent and identically distributed random variables, with $\mathbb{E}(W_i) = \mu$ y 
$Var(W_i) = \sigma^2 < \infty$. Hence: 
 \[
   \lim_{m} P\left[\frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sigma} \left(\underbrace{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m W_i}_{\overline{W}} - 
   \mu \right) \le z \right] = \phi(z)
 \]
 
where $\phi$ is the distribution function of $N(0,1)$.
 
That is, $\frac{\overline{W} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{m}} \rightarrow N(0,1)$ probability-wise.


Now, let's fix some $j\in \{1, \ldots d\}$, and let's assume that $j$-ith column follows a numerical random variable $W_j$, with mean $\mu_j$ and standard deviation $\sigma_j < \infty$. Let's compute $\sigma_j' = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \left(w_j^{(i)} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m w_j^{(i)}}{m} \right)^2}$ the biased estimation of standard deviation. It can be proven that instances generated with $\bar{w}_j = w_j^{(i)} - \frac{\sigma_j'}{\sqrt{m}}\cdot r, r\sim N(0,1)$ have the same sample mean as the original ones, and their sample variance tends to the original one.

### Outline of the algorithm
Let $S^{+}= \{x_i = (w_1^{(i)}, \ldots w_d^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^m$ be the minority instances. Our algorithm will proceed as follows:

* For each numerical attribute $j=1, \ldots, d$ compute the standard deviation of the column, $\sigma_j' = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \left(w_j^{(i)} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m w_j^{(i)}}{m} \right)^2}$.
* For a given instance $x_i=(w_1^{(i)}, \ldots, w_d^{(i)})$, for each attribute attribute $j$, generate:

\[
\bar{w}_j = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
w_j^{(i)} - \frac{\sigma_j'}{\sqrt{m}}\cdot r, r\sim N(0,1) & \textrm{if numerical attribute}\\
\textrm{pick uniformly over } \{w_j^{(1)}, \ldots w_j^{(m)}\} & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.
\]

## PDFOS
### Motivation
Given a distribution function of a random variable $X$, namely $F(x)$, if that function has an almost surely derivative, then, almost surely, it holds:
\[
  f(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{F(x+h) - F(x-h)}{2h} = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{P(x-h < X \le x+h)}{2h}
\]

Given random samples of $X$, $X_1, \ldots X_n$ y $x_1, \ldots x_n$, an estimator for $f$ could be:
\[
  \widehat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{2hn} \bigg[\textrm{NÃºmero de } x_1, \ldots, x_n \textrm{ que se quedan en ]x-h, x+h[}\bigg]
\]

If we define $\omega(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
                                \frac{1}{2} &, |x| < 1\\
                                0 & \textrm{otherwise}
                                \end{array}\right.$
                                
                                
and $w_h(x) = w\left(\left|\frac{x}{h}\right|\right)$, then we could write $\widehat{f}$ as:
\[
  \widehat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_h(x-x_i)
\]

It we assume that $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ are equidistant with distance $2h$ (they are placed in the middle of $2h$ length intervals), $\widehat{f}$ could be seen as an histogram where each bar has a $2h$ width and a 
$\frac{1}{2nh} \cdot \bigg[[\textrm{Number of samples } x_1, \ldots, x_n \textrm{ belonging to the interval}]\bigg]$ length. Parameter $h$
is called *bandwidth*.

In multivariate case, we define:
\[
  \widehat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{nh^d} \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_h(x-x_i)
\]

### Kernel methods
If we took $w = \frac{1}{2} \Large{1}\normalsize_{]-1,1[}$, then $\widehat{f}$ would have jump discontinuities and we would have jump derivatives. On the other hand, we could took $\omega$, where $w\ge 0$, $\int_{\Omega} \omega(x) dx = 1$, $\Omega \subseteq X$ a domain, and $w$ is even, and that way we could have estimators with more suitable properties with respect to continuity and differentiability.

$\widehat{f}$ can be evaluated through its MISE (*Mean Integral Squared Error*):
\[
  MISE(h) = \underset{x_1, \ldots, x_n}{\mathbb{E}} \int (\widehat{f}(x) - f(x))^2 dx
\]

```{r, out.width="60%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='Example of kernel estimation', echo=FALSE, fig.pos="h"}
knitr::include_graphics("kernel-estimation.png")
```

#### Gaussian kernels
PDFOS (*Probability Distribution density Function estimation based Oversampling*) uses multivariate Gaussian kernel methods. The probability density function of a $d$-Gaussian distribution 
with mean $0$ and $\Psi$ as its covariance matrix is:
\[
  \phi^{\Psi}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi \cdot det(\Psi))^d}} exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} x \Psi^{-1} x^T \right)
\]

Let $S^{+} = \{x_i = (w_1^{(i)}, \ldots, w_d^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^m$ be the minority instances. The unbiased covariance estimator is:
\[
  U = \frac{1}{m-1} \sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - \overline{x})(x_i - \overline{x})^T, 
  \qquad \textrm{where } \overline{x} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m x_i
\]
  
We will use kernel functions $\phi_h(x) = \phi^U\left(\frac{x}{h}\right)$, where $h$ ought to be optimized
to minimize MISE. It is well-known that can be achieved by minimizing the following cross validation function:
\[
 M(h) = \frac{1}{m^2 h^d} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m \phi_h^{\ast} (x_i - x_j) + \frac{2}{m h^d} \phi_h(0)
\]
where $\phi_h^{\ast} \approx \phi_{h\sqrt{2}} - 2\phi_h$.

Once a proper $h$ has been found, a suitable generating scheme could be to take $x_i + h R r$, where $x_i \in S^{+}$, $r\sim N^d(0,1)$ y $U = R\cdot R^T$. In case we have enough guarantees to decompose $U = R^T \cdot R$ ($U$ is a positive-definite matrix), we could use Choleski decomposition. In fact, we provide a sketch of proof showing that all covariance matrices are positive-semidefinite:

\[
y \in \mathbb{R}^d \Rightarrow: 
y^T \left(\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - \overline{x})(x_i - \overline{x})^T\right) y = \sum_{i=1}^m (\underbrace{(x_i - \overline{x})^T y}_{z_i^T})^T \underbrace{(x_i - \overline{x})^T y}_{z_i}) = \sum_{i=1}^m ||z_i||^2\ge 0
\]

### Search of optimal bandwidth
We take a first approximation to $h$ as the value:
\[
  h_{Silverman} = \left(\frac{4}{m(d+2)}\right)^{\frac{1}{d+4}}
\]
where $d$ is number of attributes and $m$ the size of the minority class.

Reshaping the equation of the cross validation function and deriving:
\begin{align}
M(h) &= \frac{1}{m^2 h^d} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m \phi_h^{\ast} (x_i - x_j) + \frac{2}{m h^d} \phi_h(0) \nonumber\\
     &= \frac{1}{m^2 h^d} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1, j\neq i}^m \phi_h^{\ast} (x_i - x_j) + \frac{1}{m h^{d}} \phi_{h\sqrt{2}}(0) \nonumber\\
     &= \frac{2}{m^2 h^d} \sum_{j > i}^m \phi_h^{\ast} (x_i - x_j) + \frac{1}{m h^{d}} \phi_{h\sqrt{2}}(0)
 \label{eq:cv-simp}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial M}{\partial h}(h) &= \frac{2}{m^2 h^d} \sum_{j>i}^m  \phi_h^{\ast} (x_i - x_j)
 \bigg(-d h^{-1} + h^{-3} (x_i-x_j)^T U (x_i-x_j) \bigg) \nonumber
 - \frac{dh^{-1}}{mh^{d}} \phi_{h\sqrt{2}}(0)
 \label{eq:cross-val-df}
\end{align}

And a straightforward *gradient descendent* algorithm is used to find a good $h$ estimation.
